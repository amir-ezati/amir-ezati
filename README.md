# Amir Ezati

Backend Engineer • Founder @ Majazite

I design and build scalable backend systems with a strong focus on clean architecture,
data integrity, and long-term maintainability.

## What I'm working on
- **Kontacta** — a backend learning project built in 4 different stacks to deeply understand architectural trade-offs:
  - JavaScript + Express + Sequelize (in progress)
  - TypeScript + Express + TypeORM
  - TypeScript + Fastify + Drizzle
  - TypeScript + NestJS + Fastify + Prisma

- **Telegram Bot Framework (PHP)** — a modular and extensible framework for building production-grade Telegram bots (coming soon)

## Technical Focus
- Backend architecture & system design
- RESTful APIs & data modeling
- Authentication, validation, and error handling
- Performance, reliability, and maintainability

## Tech Stack
JavaScript • TypeScript • Node.js • PHP  
PostgreSQL • MySQL • Redis  
Docker • Git • Linux

Currently building systems, not demos.
